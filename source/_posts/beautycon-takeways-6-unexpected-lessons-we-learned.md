“Erase everything you thought you knew about this generation or perhaps their approach to beauty. Natural beauty is no longer simply a part of culture. Natural beauty now defines culture.”

Beauty conventions usually are about free swag, celebrity sightings, and trendspotting. But at Beautycon LA, we had been shocked to find something else - a revolutionary spirit.

Beautycon was a lot more compared to the latest lipstick start. We hung out with persons from literally every backdrop and walk of life, whether it was the woman who wore her day-to-day makeup, the person who went full-on “Kardashian,” the grandma with sky-large faux lashes, or the 8-year-old protected in glitter - all united in shared kindness, respect, and love.

It probably has everything regarding Beautycon founder and CEO Moj Mahdara, who used her advertising/Hollywood backdrop along with her intersectional identity to help transform the wonder space from what it’s become today.

“Research shows that wonder influencers have officially become the single best approach to hook up with Pivotals,” Mahdara asserts in FOMO, a data-driven examination to examine the real motivations of “Pivotals” (a good term coined to refer to consumers between the age ranges of 13 to 34). “We realize this instinctively at Beautycon, because we realize that beauty is more than makeup products or program tutorials. For the Pivotals, beauty is certainly a springboard to create different communities and self-expressions.”

According the analysis, 86% of “Pivotals” declare that the biggest adjust in culture today may be the freedom expressing yourself nevertheless, you want. And makeup, selfcare, and wellness designs are intrinsically related to self-expression.

This focus was clear in conditions of what Beautycon was really about. Listed below are our six most desired takeaways we learned.

#### 1. Inclusivity is not a fad

We grew up in Sassy, Teen, YM and Seventeen. The ‘90s were great for lots of things, but diversity and inclusivity in the wonder space was NOT one of them. All we recognized was a beauty space that gave us a huge amount of methods to “fix” all of the ways we didn’t obviously fall within a narrow screen of tall, thin, blonde, and/or in a natural way straight non-frizzy hair.

To attend a beauty convention and become surrounded by every nationality, ability, gender identification, sexuality - and to see cosmetic as a primary device for self-expression instead of self-correction - was mind-blowing.

A moment we’ll remember from the weekend: overhearing within an all-gender bathroom two girls stopping mid-conversation to tell another boy dressed up in a fantastic striped jumpsuit with fluorescently shaded hair and a complete face of make-up who was simply washing his hands that his appear was “fire, seriously fire.”

How far we’ve come.

#### 2. Authenticity is mandatory

Literally all successful persons (e.g. Manny MUA, Accidental Icon, Mario Dedivanovic, Tokyo Stylez) attributed their victory to being themselves - despite how many other persons thought (including, or specifically, bullies). They motivated the crowd to dismiss criticism, judgement, or self-censorship and permit their authenticity shine.

What we witnessed was a give attention to basing your *lewk* certainly not on trends or assimilation, but one’s own personality or unique identity. Popular items were not to be utilized at face value, but as a starting point of iteration.

#### 3. Empathy is beauty

For an event that drew tens of thousands of people, we couldn’t help but notice how everyone was genuinely nice to each other. The “mean young girls” mentality of beauty is firmly passe.

Using one panel that presented two Riverdale stars, Rocsi Diaz, the moderator said, “We don’t want to pit you against each other.” Refreshing, in a world where Twitter beefs and rivalries seem to be to be the norm from reality superstars to persons in public office.

Jessica Smalls shared her inspirational storyline about how concealer can get you out the entranceway. She suffered from epidermis cancer and found it empowering to look for a approach to shield herself from unnecessary attention. 

When the Glam Squad panel was asked about beauty application faux pas they didn’t offer hacks, but a philosophical lesson. Jessica told us “not be judgemental in what other people are doing to get out of the home that day.”

#### 4. Niche may be the new mainstream

All over the place we looked, we saw considerably more people playing and tinkering with constructs. The simply “blending in” these were interested in was their foundation basic.

This is why psychographic targeting will surely replace basic demographic marketing with regards to the business of beauty. This means that “Piviotals” are applying an increasing number of descriptors like refugee, sexually liquid or mixed competition to define themselves - which is vastly more exact compared to the binary lens of previous century.

Just just as Twitter has democratized consumer demand, this trend gets the potential to possibly the using field for makes with niche or alternative aspects.

#### 5. …but celebrity doesn’t hurt

People are still quite definitely ready to stand in brand for hours for Kylie Jenner’s lip gloss - despite the fact that they’re able to purchase it online. Not forgetting the temperature basically rose 10 degrees at Kim Kardashian’s fireside chat because of the sheer number of crammed bodies in attendance.

And did you know Snoop Dogg is a wild hair hero? He provided a discuss black hair, that was dope and unpredicted! He kept us with sage wisdom: “The better your head of hair, the better your daily life.” We’ll have what he’s smoking cigarettes, thanks!

Influencers still hold plenty of power found in this new world, but because of the general embrace of specialization, there’s nobody look that rules all of them. There’s a good amount of room at the top.

#### 6. Empowerment is normally evolving from mindfulness to action

There were lots of career-oriented, intention-making activities at Beautycon. However, they seemed to take the idea a step further and focus on being the change they would like to see on the globe.

From candle-lighting ceremonies to goal-setting, there is something for anyone seeking to get things done beyond their make-up routine. This seems more than just coincidentally linked to our current political ambiance. It’s about the do (while even now caring about your do).

This is exactly what happens when an unconventional beauty person - a CEO who’s a gay first-generation Iranian-American school dropout who wears no makeup- disrupts old norms for the better.

Using outer expression as a lens to target inward, it taught us more about ourselves than we expected.
