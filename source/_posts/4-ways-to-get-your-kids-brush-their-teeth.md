## Build a Life-long Beneficial Toothcare Routine for Your Kids

For many parents, teaching their kids good dental hygiene is a twice-daily battle. But as experts point out, it’s a fight worth having. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tooth decay remains the most common chronic disease among children. Poor oral hygiene has been linked to everything from speech delays to dental pain and infections to diabetes.

Here are four ways to make brushing a fun part of your child’s daily routine.

#### Turn toothbrushing into a game

Overturn an hourglass with colorful sand and challenge them to keep brushing until all the sand has reached the bottom. Or ask them to brush during commercial break. During each 60-second commercial, have your child brush half of their mouth. By the time they’re done, their show is back on. Just remember to turn off the TV at least a half hour before bedtime to ensure a good sleep.

#### Choose the right tools

Brushing teeth can be difficult for little hands. Choose age-appropriate tools, such as toddler toothbrush or power toothbrush can be helpful. A power toothbrush gives kids the boost to get that plaque off. If your child is hesitant to try one, let them feel the movement of the whirring bristles on the palm before starting. Also let your child pick out their favorite toothbrush.

#### Pick the right toothpaste

[Toothpaste for kids](https://www.domy.com.cn/natural-baby-toothpaste-soothe-care-funny-kids-deciduous-teeth-period-toothpaste-p14.html) are generally formulated differently. Many little kids, almost all of them don’t like the taste of ordinary toothpaste. If they don’t like the taste, or even the smell, it will be more difficult to get the toothpaste near their mouths. Moreover, excess fluoride in adults’ toothpastes causes damage to the teeth. [Domy Chemical](https://www.domy.com.cn/) launched toothpaste specifically for deciduous period. With a sweet but mild fruity flavor, natural ingredients, fluoride-free formula, and powerful cleaning capacity, your kids will be happy with such a toothpaste.

#### Set a good example

When it comes to teaching good dental hygiene, practice what you preach. Children emulate whatever their parents are doing. For added fun, pretend to be a mirror the next time you and your kid brush together, and encourage them to copy your every move. If you have more than one child, it would be a good idea to have them brushing teeth together.
