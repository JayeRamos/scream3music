#### 1. Unapology Lipstick

Founded by several lady badasses from Google, they’ve dedicated this kind of new line of lipstick to women’s empowerment - 10 percent of their profits go to a nonprofit that gives out small-business grants for women-led ventures. Score!

The lipstick itself has been referred to as having a semi-matte finish and will come in six shades. One reviewer on the site says it includes a “delicate and light sensation,” which makes sense as it has an focus on moisturizing ingredients.

Plus, they’ve got all the fix-ins for your eco-conscious needs: they’re paraben, fragrance, and cruelty free.

#### 2. The Lipstick Lobby

If you lean (very far) left of middle in terms of politics, this lipstick packs the punch you might like to give the government at this time. Some of your purchase would go to support reproductive rights, healthcare, criminal justice reform, or gun control - depending on the shade you choose.

According to Influenster, they apply a creamy method that’s great for chapped, drier lips. One reviewer was also impressed by its prolonged wear, that can be troublesome for softer lipsticks.

The Lipstick Lobby also sells other fun merch that are protest-worthy within their messages - such as a t-shirt that says “Lipstick It To The Man.” Puns + progressivism? Yes, please.

#### 3. Color The Environment Hand-Poured Lipstick

Socially conscious and looking for a wide selection of shades? There will be over 30 shades from which to choose, and each is certainly pared to a specific organization. From finding a cure for Alzheimer’s to protecting our coral reefs, there are always a wide variety of causes represented by this super-inclusive brand.

In line with the Hope Trope blog page, they are “perfect for someone who likes a moisturizing lipstick formulation or someone considering hoping a bolder lip that doesn’t wish anything too shocking.” It seems to be very best for wearers that aren’t too concerned with a good color that lasts as many a lipstick which has “build-ability” potential.

Another neat facet of this lipstick is that they’re hand-poured to order, meaning every tube is manufactured fresh just for you.

#### 4. Beautiful Privileges Lipstick & Gloss

If women’s legal rights are your jam, this company is all about it. Arises from sales visit a variety of organizations that deal with for the legal, political, and physical wellness of ladies in America.

These lipsticks cater to lips that require moisturizing, as they’re infused with oils (just like jojoba, grape-seed, and coconut). It’s a tiny line with simply four colorings and a gloss - but with more support, that could modification!

#### 5. Muskaan Hydra-Matte Lipstick

This brand impressed we whenever we met them as of this year’s FounderMade event in NYC. It both appears great and enables you to select which charity you’d prefer to support - incorporating one that helps persons displaced by the Syrian War.

We found the quality to get velvety and very matte - good for many who prefer a good firmer (rather than creamier) lipstick. But dread not! It definitely has a moisturizing think to it that’s thick and fulfilling, such as a high-top quality lotion. The best shade is called “Burkini Beach Day,” which is excellent if you’re looking for a rosy pink color that goes very well with olive undertones.

Bonus: it’s as well halal certified. Which means those who choose to keep halal as part of their standard of living can rest assured it’s up with their specific needs.

Although it’s sold out for now, make certain to follow them on FB, Twitter, and Instagram so you know when they’re prepared to ship again!
